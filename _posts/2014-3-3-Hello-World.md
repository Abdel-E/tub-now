As an athlete, it can be frustrating when you feel like you're not getting the recognition you deserve. Maybe you're not a star player on your team, or you're not getting the same level of exposure as your peers. But being an underrated athlete doesn't have to hold you back. In fact, it can be an opportunity to stand out and make a name for yourself.

Here are some tips for making yourself known as an underrated athlete:

## 1. Focus on your strengths
Just because you're not the most well-known athlete on your team or in your sport **doesn't mean you don't have strengths**. Identify what you're good at and _focus_ on honing those skills. You might not be the fastest or the strongest, but maybe you have excellent footwork or a great understanding of strategy. Embrace what sets you apart and work to make those strengths even stronger.

## 2. Be consistent
Consistency is key when it comes to standing out as an athlete. Show up to practice on time, work hard every day, and **always give 100%**. Coaches and teammates will take notice of your dedication and work ethic, and that can go a long way in making you stand out.

## 3. Make the most of every opportunity
When you're an underrated athlete, you might not get as many opportunities to shine as your peers, that's a simple fact you have to live with. But that doesn't mean you should take those opportunities for granted. Whether it's a scrimmage, a game, or a practice, give it your all and make the most of the chance to showcase your skills. You never know who might be watching.

## 4. Build your brand
In today's digital age, athletes have more opportunities than ever before to build their personal brand. Use social media to your advantage and share highlights of your best plays or training sessions. Connect with other athletes in your sport or in related fields and build relationships that can help you grow your network.

## 5. Stay humble
Finally, it's important to stay humble and grounded as you work to make a name for yourself. Being underrated can be frustrating, but it's important not to let it go to your head. Stay focused on your goals and keep working hard, and the recognition will come in time.

Being an underrated athlete can be a challenge, but it can also be an opportunity to stand out and make a name for yourself. By focusing on your strengths, being consistent, making the most of every opportunity, building your brand, and staying humble, you can rise above the competition and become a force to be reckoned with.
